Validate all untrusted data. Apply the latest patches. Scan your services and disable the ones which are not needed and are exposed unnecessarily. Exposing programs increases the attack surface. Only expose the services which are needed and have security mechanisms such as authentication built around them. Avoid revealing information about your system (e.g., version of the program) to anonymous users. Make sure that your program or service fail safely. What happen if the communication protocol is interrupted suddenly? What happen if a parameter is missing? Does your system have resistance and resilience to attack? Fail safely when a resource exhaustion occurs. If possible use a sandbox model which limits the actions that programs can take. A sandbox restricts a program to a set of privileges and commands that make it difficult or impossible for the program to cause any damage. Check your program for buffer overflow and format String vulnerabilities which can lead to execution of malicious code. Monitor traffic and resource usage and pay attention if resource exhaustion occurs. Protect your log file from unauthorized modification and log forging."}, {"type": "relationship", "spec_version": "2.1", "id": "relationship--903acd52-831f-4b12-bb2c-987f0a3c8f58", "created": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306638Z", "modified": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306638Z", "relationship_type": "midigates", "source_ref": "course-of-action--25646b51-6231-4fdb-a0a3-05f827f1bc80", "target_ref": "vulnerability--08f81de1-7db4-4b84-92ce-0f319dfb981d"}, {"type": "course-of-action", "spec_version": "2.1", "id": "course-of-action--f3faf949-ee5a-4d28-b995-cacc802be028", "created": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306812Z", "modified": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306812Z", "name": "coa-5", "description": "Design: Enforce principle of least privilege Implementation: Ensure that HTTP Get methods only retrieve state and do not alter state on the server side Implementation: Ensure that HTTP methods have proper ACLs based on what the functionality they expose"}, {"type": "relationship", "spec_version": "2.1", "id": "relationship--1322ac6a-3eb9-45c1-bbaf-e2d7f424c70a", "created": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306955Z", "modified": "2023-05-30T21:29:40.306955Z", "relationship_type": "midigates", "source_ref": "course-of-action--f3faf949-ee5a-4d28-b995-cacc802be028", "target_ref": "vulnerability--08f81de1-7db4-4b84-92ce-0f319dfb981d"}]}
